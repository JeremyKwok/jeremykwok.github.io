# Investment options
## Direct Equity (Stocks in SGX, NYSE, NASDAQ etc.)
### Exchanges
We can invest equity in different exchanges. Every exchange opens at a different time. A general rule of thumb is that it will open from 10 am to 4 pm in the timezone it is located at. A exchange can contain stocks from other countries and a stock can be listed in multiple exchanges.

#### Which exchange to invest in
Generally, would depend on the timing you want to make your investment, currency and volatility. Unless you don't mind holding on to a different currency, it is better to trade in your local currency so that you can avoid unnecessary foreign exchange fees. If you are interested in doing short term trading, exchanges with high volumes of trades would be better.

### Types
When I invest in stocks, I usually place them in self-created categories
* Blue Chip
  * An example would be something stable and dividend producing like Coca Cola $NYSE: KO.
* High Growth (Tech)
  * This category will be for innovators and disrupters which I feel have high growth potential.
  * An example would be Docusign $NASDAQ: DOCU.
  * I would also include large cap stocks which I think still can grow far such as Tencent $HKG: 0700 or Mercado Libre $NASDAQ: MELI.
* Too risky
  * An example is
* Diversity
  * I will put Healthcare stocks, Food Stocks and other prominent stocks here.
  * Example: Intuitive Surgical $NASDAQ: ISRG or Veeva Systems $NYSE: VEEV or Beyond Meat Inc $NASDAQ: BYND.
