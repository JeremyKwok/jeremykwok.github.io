# Unit Trust Investing
## Why
I have recently picked up investing using [Unit Trusts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unittrust.asp) because I feel like I don't have enough time to monitor my own personal investments and do not have sufficient capital to play with many stocks. In short,
* Diversify portfolio at low cost
* Do not need to monitor portfolio often

A popular alternative is [roboinvestors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/roboadvisor-roboadviser.asp). However, they tend to 
* only rebalance quarterly
* higher fees
* smaller assets under management which make them more risky

See other [alternatives](/InvestmentOptions.md).

## How
If we look at unit trusts there are a few options avaliable. 3 of the most popular platforms are [POEMS](https://www.poems.com.sg/), [FSM](https://secure.fundsupermart.com/fsm/home) and [DollarDex](https://www.dollardex.com/sgn/).

| Platforms  | Platform Fees | Mobile Application  | Web Application  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| DollarDex  | No  | No  | Yes  |
| FSM  | Yes  | Yes  | Yes  |
| POEMS  | No  | Yes  | Yes  |

I chose DollarDex in the end because I felt their web interface was pretty good and it was the first one I tried.

## Sign up
Signing up with DollarDex can be done from their website and will require:
* NRIC
* bank account details and statement
* Proof you know how to invest
  * Diploma/Degree (Finance/Business related)
  * Have done past investment
* Risk appetite

Overall, it is very long because of their due dilligence which can be good or bad.

## Searching for funds

My greatest irk about their web application is their lack of search functionality. They pride themselves on being able to filter funds down based on what the customer wants. This means they can seperate based on the type of the funds, CPF approved, sector etc. This is great if you don't know what you are looking for except for the fact that individuals who don't know what they are looking for usually may not know how exactly the market classifies a fund. Sometimes a fund may not be classified accurately anyway. A search field is the most basic functionality we would expect nowadays. Even if it is too dificult to include, one that works for ISIN/ Bloomberg tickers should be simple.

Their redeeming grace is that they have a watchlist which can help you add funds for quick access and compare funds.

You can customise what parameters you look at in your watch list and compare funds pages.

Another annoying workaround I had to do was to use Bloomberg for actual tracking. DollarDex only informs you of your P/L based on the net amount you invested rather than each transaction. Sometimes I want to see the current day performance which bloomberg provides but DollarDex does not provide at a glance. *You can view it but more clicks are needed.

We would believe that since the transaction data is stored in a database, you would easily be able to see it by each transaction. However, this is something both platforms do not have, GoogleFinance used to provide it before Google shut it down.

## Buying a fund
Notably, DollarDex also provides Fund Rankings, allowing novince investors an easy way to invest in historically well performing funds.

From there, you can add to your shopping cart. It is a 4 step process.

Step 1: Enter amount

Step 2: Select account

Step 3: Payment method

Step 4: Confirmation

After that, they will give you details of payment to be made and send you an email. It is important to note that they will only transact the unit after payment. Hence, the fund may be more expensive or cheaper than expected.
